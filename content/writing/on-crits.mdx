title: On crits
---

A great design critique is a collaborative exercise in making the work better. It is not a trial. This is a collection of principles and reminders I’ve collected over the years to make crits most effective.

**Core principles**

* Critique the design, not the designer. Focus feedback on the design artifact and its relationship to the goals. Separate the person from their output.
* Explain your "why." Subjective feedback like "I don't like it" is a dead end. Ground your comments in the project goals, user needs, or established principles. E.g., "This layout feels crowded, which might overwhelm a new user trying to complete the primary task."
* Listen to understand, not to reply. As a presenter, absorb feedback without immediately trying to  justification. As a reviewer, ask clarifying questions to understand the rationale before jumping to conclusions.
* Be direct, but kind. Avoid "compliment sandwiches" or vague feedback. Clear, constructive communication delivered with respect is most effective.
* All work is welcome. Critiques are for every stage, from messy whiteboard sketches to high-fidelity prototypes. Vulnerability, especially from senior designers, builds psychological safety.

**Getting great feedback**

Your job is to set the stage and guide the conversation to get the feedback you need.
* Frame the problem first. Before showing any work, state the goal, define the target user, and list the key constraints. No one should have to guess.
* Ask for what you need. Be explicit. Tell the group where you're struggling and what kind of feedback is (and is not) useful at this stage.
* Synthesize, don't just apply. You are the owner of the work. It is your responsibility to filter, interpret, and selectively incorporate feedback—not to implement every suggestion.

**Giving great feedback**

Help the presenter see their work from a new perspective and improve its quality.
* Question, don't prescribe. Instead of saying "Change the button to blue," ask "What was the thinking behind using red here? Have you considered how it might align with our accessibility standards for color contrast?"
* Praise what works. A critique isn't just about finding flaws. Highlighting successful elements provides positive reinforcement and ensures they aren't accidentally removed.
* Foster a dialogue, not a monologue. Build on the comments of others. A great critique is a conversation between everyone in the room, not just a back-and-forth with the presenter.

**Traps**

Anti-patterns to avoid
* Solutioning: Identifying problems is the goal. Trying to design a complete solution on the spot wastes time and stifles the presenter's ownership.
* HiPPO Hijack: The "Highest Paid Person's Opinion" should not dominate. Leaders should facilitate and amplify other voices, not deliver top-down edicts.
* Deciding A critique is a forum for feedback and exploration, not the place for making final product roadmap decisions or securing official sign-offs.
* Attack/Defend: This is a collaboration, not a confrontation. If the session feels like a trial, the process is broken.
