title: My compass
---

**How I define success**
* My family feels seen, supported, and curious
* I’m building things I’m proud of
* My body is regularly tired in a good way
* I’m learning faster than I’m aging
* I have increasing freedom to choose what’s next

**5 principles**
1. Family before everything: Presence, stability, or growth for my family come first
2. Create more than I consume: I’m at my best when I’m building, contributing, or improving something real.
3. Growth through challenge: Hard things - physical, mental, creative - are how I stay sharp and honest
4. Stay curious: Stagnation is the fastest way to lose energy and perspective
5. Earn optionality: Money, skills, and reputation are tools for choice - not status

**Default behaviors**
* Energy: Protect mornings for personal time and evenings & weekends for family. Bias toward deep work. Use physical challenge to reset and calibrate.
* Craft: Building, fixing, or clarifying over reacting. Solve worthwhile problems for real people and real tangible utility.
* Curiosity: Always have a skill, idea, or place I’m exploring. Read and learn with intent, not volume. Translate learning into output quickly.
* Optionality: Spend intentionally. Avoid lifestyle drift. Invest in skills, leverage, and durability. Optimize for freedom of choice, not status.

**Tradeoffs I accept**
* Fewer late nights and “hero” moments at work
* Saying no to opportunities that look impressive but cost presence
* Being less “up to date” on everything
* Temporary fatigue and frustration
* Being a beginner more often
* Investing time without immediate payoff
* Turning down roles or paths that lock me in
