title: Durable themes
---

I’ve noticed I keep returning to a small set of durable focus areas every year. They help me prioritize how I spend my time and guide teams. They also tend to be a good rubric when I reflect on the work we’re doing. 

**Coherence**

Coherence is bigger than consistency. Consistency is just hygiene. Coherence is the feeling that workflows, decisions, and interactions fit together across the entire system. Coherence shows up in end-to-end journeys that reduce mental overhead. In adjacent products that feel related instead of random. In internal processes that actually reflect how the work happens. And most importantly, it shows up in how quickly a team can learn, adapt, and align - the metabolism of the team.

**Leverage**

Most designers can push pixels. Great designers push systems. Leverage is about increasing impact without increasing effort. It comes from first-principles thinking, strong design systems, and intentionally shaping the machine behind the work. And now, AI multiplies all of that. Designers with leverage don’t just make better screens. They make better ways of making.

**Depth**

Most people avoid depth. Depth is the willingness to sit with customers long enough to understand their fears, shortcuts, and pressures - not just their “needs.” It’s the craft of making something feel right, not just look right. It’s taste, detail, and the judgment you develop after dozens of iterations. Depth also shows up in personal growth: reading broadly, experimenting, being willing to be wrong. 

**Energy**

Energy is the cultural heartbeat of a team. It shows up in the spaces where we think, the rituals that shape our weeks, and the pace at which we move. When the energy is right, teams collaborate easily, ship faster, and push each other toward better work. When it’s off, even simple tasks feel heavy. Great teams are intentional about their energy: where focus happens, where collaboration happens, how crits run, when to jam, when to slow down, when to sprint. 

**Ownership**

Ownership is putting your name on the product. It means making sure nothing falls through the cracks and treating the product like it’s yours even when it isn’t. Designers with high ownership make decisions quickly and thoroughly. They have an insatiable need to discover the right problems to solve. They do their own QA and testing, and follow through when they ship.
